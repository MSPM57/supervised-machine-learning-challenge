Predict Model Performance
You will be creating and comparing two models on this data: a Logistic Regression, and a Random Forests Classifier. Before you create, fit, and score the models, make a prediction as to which model you think will perform better. You do not need to be correct!

The Data is to be split into Training and Testing Sets.

Create, Fit and Compare Models
Create a Logistic Regression model, fit it to the training data that you created in the previous step. Then, determine the model's score by using the score function and the testing data from the previous step. Do the same for a Random Forest Classifier. You may choose any starting hyperparameters you like.

Review the scores of each model. Which model performed better? How does that compare to your prediction? Write down your results and thoughts in the designated markdown cell.

I predicted the Linear Regression MOdel would work the best and the data seemed to be linear and not overly complex.

Here were the results for Linear REgression Model:

0.9941188609162196
0.9971798046498831 using scaled

Here were the results for Random Forest Classifier Model:
0.9971798046498831
0.9971798046498831 using scaled

My conclusion:
Both models performed about the same. I did note Linear Regression had some a slight changed between using unscaled and scaled data versus the Random Forest Classifier model was almost identical between using unscaled and scaled data.
